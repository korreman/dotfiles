# Korreman's config

Configuration files for a modular, minimalist environment. Written to work with the Arc Light theme.


## Manual usage

There is currently no installation script, so files must be manually symlinked or copied.

For Kakoune to work, a symbolic link must be created to the `autoload` folder (usually `/usr/share/kak/autoload/`), placed in `config/kak/autoload/`.
