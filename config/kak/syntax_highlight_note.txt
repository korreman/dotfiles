Syntax highlighting faces are misused, and their vague definitions make more distinct highlighting styles look bad in many cases. Things like bolded text, colored background highlights, etc. Maybe the following would be better:

Directive
Macro

Module
Function
Variable

Type
TypeConstructor
Attribute

Keyword
Operator

Literal
StringLiteral
TokenLiteral

Comment
Documentation

Bold
Italic
Underline
